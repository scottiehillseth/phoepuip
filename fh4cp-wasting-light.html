                            <p> and my life was never the same. üêêüêêüêêüêêüêê. I know this has been done to death, but I think this is the closest thing that I'll ever have to a perfect album. Time and time again I always find myself coming back to this album even when I thought I'd never get hooked on its songs ever again even after singing them for the millionth time in a row. I really do love Wasting Light and I think it really goes beyond most of what their other work has done (huge Echoes fan too though.) I'm really excited for their next album too, I hope they contin. Hello, Does anyone have a download of the high quality audio from live at 606 from 2012? I have searched a lot of different places and am wondering if anyone has that in their collection. Thanks. I haven't been active in this community before but I'm getting more into Foo Fighters now; my first proper listen into the band was with Wasting Light and after listening to the other albums, it's still my favorite. Not sure what the consensus Last night I listened to most of Wasting Light whilst driving home on empty, dark roads. It really helped capture the atmosphere of some of the songs. 'Matter of time ' sounded like a completely new song, the intriticate guitar melodies and earnest , soothing vocals in the verses accompanied the relaxing night drive perfectly. >Iv'e been listening to random stuff because I'm in the phase where my favorite music is boring and I look for new stuff but I remembered that wasting light is a thing that exists and its nostalgic because I first listened to that album when I was 12 (I think, maybe 11) And its really good when you listen to something but then listen a second time and you really feel the music.
