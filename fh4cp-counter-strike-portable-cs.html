Gente, todo en orden? Bueno, la cosa es asi, este viernes es la cena/fiesta de fin de año en mi empresa, y quieren instalarnos el cs 1.6 para que juguemos un rato antes de arrancar para el bolichon. Mi jefe me pregunto a mi si podia encargarme de conseguir el juego, trucho, obviamente, y que, de ser posible, no tenga que ser instalado.

I’m carrying it around every single day I’m at school, so ideally something on the lighter. > What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. Mostly developing and playing casual games (cs global offensive, league of legends) > What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? around 1000€, but would prefer less. > When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy. within I'm a sucker for CS portable, a multiplayer FPS: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioOnMars.CSPortable "Critical Strike Portable" but feels like Counter Strike, the PC game from ~10 years ago. Lots of fun, esp. with a shotgun. Total budget and country of purchase: Preferably no more than 00. Lower is better if the things I need it for can be had for less. USA Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.

MAINLY I just want a portable laptop that can handle games. My current laptop takes like 5 minutes to even join a CS game. Usually my friends are in-game for 3-4 minutes by the time I actually connect. I'm the slowest to reach 100% on League. So anything that could make gaming more fun would be great. Thanks!

So I'm finally through with high school (huzzah!) and I'm buying a whole bunch of new stuff for college with the intention that it'll last me through the next four years (and potentially beyond).

Looking to build a small, portable and budget friendly computer. Something that resembles the practicality of a console. Can hook up to a TV, play games, stream media. I used to play a lot of simplistic, competitive shooters on PC (like CS 1.6). I know games have come a long way since 1.6, but on this budget I would just like to be able to get into CS:GO at 60+ fps. I'm pretty far from a graphics guru. I'm much more focused on smooth frame rates for playability in counter strike and other mainst. my comp blows, i can't play anything, even the games i've been gifted on steam/can't even run fucking tf2. so yea, anyone want to play this? its a smartphone and computer game based off counter strike. It's fun, just not enough players on the computer version. video of gameplay here if anyone is a bit interested. 30 mb zip for the game. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBA7tJWwQc0. Hello guys I am in high school and I am looking for a versatile laptop that can be used as a 2nd gaming machine at home for my dad since I already have a gaming rig and we would like to play some games together and a not very heavy portable workstation for school. The games we would mostly play are CS:GO, Dota 2, and other light games for on the road. I dont want anything too flashy with LEDs everywhere since it will attract too much attention at High School. LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE Countr. First off, a bit of admin stuff. I have already "grabbed" 2 games, one in a thread like this, and another in an "offer" thread, and I can't tell if it's showing up in my flair. I thought I would try and make this clear in case it puts people off. (I do feel a little bad about taking, and not giving, so until I get some money to give back to the community as a whole, I'll hold off a little.) Anyway, this is the part where I explain why I want the game. Unlike many others, I have no real Counter. We need to follow few steps to can play Counter Strike 1.6. 1.
